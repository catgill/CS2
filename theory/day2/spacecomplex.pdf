In this problem the space taken by the two dimensional array "squares" could
potentially go to infinity if you were to demand a board that big. With each
increase in size of the rows or columns of the board the memory used and run
time both increase at the same speed, since with each point added a certain
amount of processing time is also added, meaning that this function is linear
